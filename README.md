# BPI Modeling : Coordination in Manufacturing

## Overview

🏭 This document, part of the Business Process Innovation course at NJIT, delves into the intricacies of manufacturing business coordination, focusing on communication breakdowns and process modeling.


## Objective

🎯 The aim is to analyze and model business processes within a manufacturing setting, using the commitment management protocol and actor-transaction diagrams to showcase communication dynamics and process efficiencies.

## Background

📚 Inspired by Jan Dietz's "The Deep Structure of Business Processes," this document explores the Actor Transaction Diagram (ATD) methodology to dissect and improve business process coordination.

## Business Scenario

🔍 Examining a typical manufacturing company's workflow, we analyze the AS-IS process of handling a special customer order, highlighting the crucial coordination steps and identifying areas for optimization.

## Assignment Insights

1. **Actors Identification**: Uncovering the key players like the Customer, Sales, Planning Manager, Supplier, Production Manager, and Shipper.
2. **Transaction Analysis**: Mapping out the intricate transactions between these actors to streamline the process flow.
3. **Process Modeling**: Constructing Top-Level and Detail-Level ATDs to visualize and refine the existing AS-IS and proposed TO-BE processes.

## Key Takeaways

- **Enhanced Process Understanding**: Gaining insights into the commitment management protocol and its impact on business communication.
- **Strategic Improvements**: Identifying missing speech acts and optimizing the transaction sequence for a more efficient TO-BE process.

## Usage

👩‍💻 This repository serves as an academic reference and practical guide for students and professionals interested in process innovation within manufacturing industries.
